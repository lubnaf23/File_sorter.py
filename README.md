# Q/A System
#### -Lubna Firdaus

A simple Question and Answer system that allows users with different roles (Admin, Student, etc.) to interact with each other. Admins can manage users and view all users, while students can ask and view questions.

## Features
- Login: Users can log in with their username and password.
- Roles: Users can have multiple roles (e.g., Admin, Student) and select which one they want to use.
### Admin Features:
- Invite users (add new users to the system).
- View all users in the system.
- Logout from the admin menu.
### Student Features:
- Ask questions to the system.
- View all previously asked questions.
- Logout from the student menu.

## How It Works
1. First-Time Setup: When the program starts for the first time, it creates an Admin and Student if they do not already exist.
2. Login: After the setup, you can log in with the predefined admin or student credentials:
  - Admin: admin, Password: admin123
  - Student: student, Password: student123
3. Role Selection: If a user has multiple roles, they can select which role they want to use.
4. Menu System: After logging in, the program shows a menu based on the user's role (Admin or Student) with different options.
5. Exiting: Users can exit the program at any time.
